Q1: Assuming that the following JOS kernel code is correct, what type
    should variable x have, uintptr_t or physaddr_t?
	mystery_t x;
	char* value = return_a_pointer();
	*value = 10;
	x = (mystery_t) value;
A1: uintptr_t. All pointers in C are virtual address, thus `vaule` is a
    virtual address, and x means the virtual address of `*vaule`.
